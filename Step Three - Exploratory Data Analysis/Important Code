IGNORE CELL NUMBERS AS THEY ARE WRONG!:

1. Cell 2: setting the style for dark colab notebook
2. Good storytelling of EDA using each variable
3. Cell 18: Create ratios to get derived numbers (ex. resorts per 100k people in a state)
4. Above cell 23: PCA with 8 website links
  scaling the data to get z-scores
5. Cell 23: code to save index labels and column labels to use with scaled and transformed data by turning the array back into dataframes. 
  Also can use for annotations when plotting
6. Reminder that pandas std() uses ddof=1 standard so have to change to 0 to have it match sklearn scaling
7. Cell 31 and 34: .explained_variance_ratio_.cumsum()) is like ECDF() and has helpful link above cell 31
8 Cell 31: plt.subplot is a way to set figure size.
9. Cell 36. Python f-strings for displaying percentages in titles and print(). Helpful link above Cell 35.
10. Cell 36: Zip and Annotate in plotting.
11. Example of groupby to get average price per state
12. PCA scatterplot of first 2 components (best example is seaborn as it has sizes, quartiles, and colors, oh my!)
  concat with y variable and quartile to help see y-variable better
13. pandas categories: new datatype
14. Example code for showing 7 components (for 7 variables), turning it into a dataframe from array, and using column labels:
  pd.DataFrame(state_pca.components_, columns=state_summary_columns)
15. Examples to find rows in columns and compare it to scaled version. This is because PCA had high numbers in 2 columns and we saw 2 states with high numbers in first 2 components
16. ratios of each row (resort) compared to its state data (such as resort skiable terrain compared to total state terrain)
17. Example of custom function to create scatter subplots to compare variables to y-variable.
  Also list comprehension to to exclude y-variable and categorical variables from independent numerical variables
18. example code to save csv in colab (but have to download to machine anyway)
